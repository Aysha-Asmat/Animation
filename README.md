# Animation
an animation and a game in assembly language
In this project, you have to make an animation of infinite length and phase I includes printing of “still” main screen only (without any movement).
[Phase I – Printing Main Screen] Your main screen should fulfill following requirements:
Your main screen will be divided into three parts: background, foreground and reserved space.
Background: Top 1/3rd (or so) of your screen will have some background with objects e.g. mountains, buildings, trees etc.
Foreground: Middle 1/3rd (or so) of the screen will have some foreground with objects e.g. road having some vehicle(s) or sea having ship(s) etc.
Reserved Space: Bottom 1/3rd (or so) will be reserved “still” space may be part of sea or grass.
Currently the scene will be either daytime or nighttime; no change is required in main screen in this phase.
